This app is a guided meditation.                              
It teaches you what to do with a negative feeling other than avoid it, evade it, run away from it with distractions like food, 
drink, smoke, business, shopping, etc.                                                                    
When it comes to a bad emotion, the mentally healthy response is to process, process, process.                                                                                      This is a thought exercise. The main action here is between your ears.
It is to be done as a reflection upon a feeling, sitting still, like you do when you meditate.                                                The guidance of the app is the process of answering questions about the distressing feeling.                                                          It is best to do alone in a quiet place where your thinking will be undisturbed.                                          You may even want to close your eyes as you go through each question, as you reflect upon your answers thoughtfully. In this stillness you make a space for healing, where your feelings are acknowledged, not denied.
                                                                      
The goal is to reach some understanding about the feeling that you had that bothered you, that you didn't know what to do with.
When you reach this clarity, you're done with part 2 and can finish with part 3, which is the end of this exercise. There you 
will have a space to write about the experience of your reflections upon the bothersome feeling. It is not meant to be kept 
like a journal, but released, like what you do with a feeling once you've processed it. Resolve and let go.    
Thus, your journal will remember your entry for only one week.                                                       
This exercise is a model for what to do with bad feelings to maintain good mental health, by knowing how to stay in the moment 
and up-to-date with them. Being in the now is where to be authentic. It is where your personal growth, emotional intelligence 
and maturity can be developed, and where your consciousness can be raised.

It is possible to go through dozens of questions in this app. If, after reflecting upon them, you’re still confused about the 
feeling that you’re dealing with, you may want to seek outside counselling, as the feeling may be coming up from a very old, 
deep hurt or buried pattern of behavior.

Being well is about the collection of experiences gathered in pursuit of chill, calm centeredness.
The demand for fully inclusive wellness and lifestyle experiences will continue to be a challenge as responsible and socially 
conscious work moves to the forefront. 
Creatives play a strong hand in deciding which experiences people have and who those experiences are designed for. 
Manifesting wellness into digital and physical experiences will continue to be a big contribution from creatives in the tech 
industry. Whether it is a mobile app for meditation or a multi-level experience of chill design, user experience and technology 
are at the heart of the modern wellness movement.
